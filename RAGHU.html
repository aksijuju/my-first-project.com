                    help you plan and track your work effectively. You can create and customize multiple views by
                    filtering, sorting, grouping your issues and pull requests, adding custom fields to track metadata
                    specific to your team, and visualize work with configurable charts. Rather than enforcing a specific
                    methodology, a project provides flexible features you can customize to your team's needs and
                    processes.</p>
